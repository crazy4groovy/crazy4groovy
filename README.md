# Hi there, and welcome 👋

My name is Steve Olsen. I'm a passionate Sr. JS developer (since 2005), compassionate team leader, organized project manager, motivated entrepreneur, and avid husband/father.

> STATUS: Open to part-time contract work

Here are some of my projects I've been having fun on (some recent, some older):

## Online educator and mentor (__Sr. JS Dev__)

> Goal: To fast-track Jr. developers into Sr. developers, by teaching (and practicing) advanced principles, tips, and techniques to code high-quality & _MAINTAINABLE_ software. Let's get _more_ __Sr.-leveled__ developers into the marketplace, because the industry needs it!
